\section{Parallelization Techniques}
\label{sec:parallel}

Here we survey some powerful techniques behind a recent trend of work on
constant-depth circuits. In \cite{Moore1999} it was known that the unbounded
fanout gate and the parity gate were equivalent, in the sense that conjugating
one by Hadamards on every qubit gave you the other circuit, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:parity-fanout}
