In this report, we examine low-depth quantum architectures as a unifying
theme for classical control, parallelism in circuit construction,
error-correction, magic state distillation, and Hamiltonian simulation.
We introduce a new circuit resource known as \emph{space}, in addition to
size, width, and depth. We examine uninitialized qubits,
approximate algorithms, and the optimization of QFT circuits over time.
We provide both theoretical and experimental context for these themes.
Finally, we propose
future directions for quantum architecture research related to
improving circuit space, uncomputation, modular coherent states, and magic state
interconversion.
