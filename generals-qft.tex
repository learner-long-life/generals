\section{Quantum Fourier Transform}
\label{sec:qft}

As an illustration of this new circuit model, with the resources of
\emph{circuit space} and \emph{unitialized ancillae} that we established in
the previous section, we will examine a core building block of many
quantum algorithms: the quantum Fourier transform (QFT).

[Presumably in the previous section, I discussed the limits of the depth-only
model, especially if it blows up in the number of ancillae, which is why I
introduced the idea of circuit space to begin with. Uninitialized qubits is
more of a curiosity at this point, and our only link to magic state distillation].

The QFT is responsible for most of our examples of an exponential quantum
speedup over classical algorithms (cite Shor's original paper etc), usually
by reducing problems to the framework of the hidden subgroup problem
(cite Chris Lomont's review paper). The most famous example is, of course,
Shor's algorithm for the prime factorization of large integers, which would
break the widely-deployed RSA cryptosystem. Therefore, it is a useful
module to study and optimize, and indeed, much attention has been devoted
to reducing its depth over the years, making it a great place to first apply
our model.

\subsection{Analogy to Classical Fourier Transform}

First, we will say a little bit more about the QFT itself. As the name implies,
it is inspired by the classical Fourier transform, which is used to convert
information in one representation (say, sound amplitudes over time) into another
representation (say, signal power over frequency). These representations are
equivalent, but some tasks are easier to do in one representation than another.
For example, in analyzing a sound recording in the time domain, many frequencies overlap and it
may be difficult to detect and remove a source of noise, let's say a low-frequency
hum associated with electrical mains power frequency. However, in the frequency
domain, it is easy to pick out a peak at 60 MHz, which is the frequency at
which North American power companies deliver power at alternating current.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Sound recording in the time and frequency domains}
\end{figure}

Does this equation have anything to do with the discrete classical Fourier
transform? I hope so. Fact check this!

\begin{equation}
x_j = \sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1} e^{-i2\pi j}y_k
\end{equation}

By analogy, in many quantum algorithms we can encode useful information
into the phases associated with the probability amplitudes of different
computational basis states. Our usual goal is to interfere these phases
both constructively and destructively, to maximize the probability of measuring
the computational basis state that corresponds to a correct answer to our
problem. The restriction is that we can only do this using local operations,
that, by operating on a few neighboring qubits at a time. Through this means,
we are effectively operating on many computational basis states in parallel,
due to the way quantum states combine through the tensor product structure.

[somewhere in the previous section, i unveil my famous spectrum picture
of quantum states, and demonstrate some examples of highly-entangled
states and product states]

\subsection{Product Representation and Phase Wheel Picture}

In one domain, we have information encoded in the bits of the computational
basis states, but these are just encodings, and you can imagine them
evolving happily in their own separate alternate universes until one of them
is selected by random chance by a measurement at the end.
In the second domain, we have the phases of each computational basis state,
and the way we can get different computational basis states to interact, or
to create more or less of them, is through two-qubit entangling gates.
Actually, now we are on thin ice, and I should think carefully about what I
want to say here, especially as it relates to universality.

Now the quantum analogues of the classical FT equations above.

\begin{equation}
\ket{x_j} = \sum_{k=0}^{2^n} e^{i\pi k / 2^n}\ket{y_k}
\end{equation}

What is the relationship between computational basis states and their
corresponding Fourier transform? I'm glad you asked that! Now I can break out
my famous rotating phase wheel picture.

\begin{figure}
\caption{My famous rotating phase wheel picture}
\end{figure}

The way to convert in between these two domains is the QFT, specifically
through the famous product representation. In particular, because of the
symmetry of the Fourier transform state, we can decompose the phase into
a controlled-rotation on each bit, where $j$ is decomposed into the
usual binary representation.

\begin{equation}
j = \sum_{\ell=0}^n 2^\ell j_\ell 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\ket{x_j} = \otimes_{k=0}^{n}
\frac{\ket{0} + e^{2\pi j_0 \cdots j_k}\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}

In particular, we can rotate the phase on the $\ket{1}$ part of each qubit by
increasingly more digits of significance of the overall phase shift $j$.
Somewhere I should also talk about phase significance, and how some qubits
have a greater influence on the overall phase of their corresponding
computational basis state. This depends, of course, on there first being
a $\ket{1}$ part to rotate. Starting from an initial state of $\ket{0}$, we
need to introduce a Hadamard to get an equal mix. Also, the rotation part is
achieved by controlled rotation gates $R_k$ of the following form:

\begin{equation}
R_k = \begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & e^{i\pi / 2^k}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Oh we should also note somewhere that the QFT can be generalized into the
Walsh-Hadamard transform, or that the Hadamard is just a QFT on 1-qubit.
Also, these QFT's all work on a modulus which is a power-of-two, $q=2^n$. This
is not always that useful in factoring, for example, since the modulus $q$ is
the number we are trying to factor, and if we already know it's a power-of-two,
well, you can see what I am getting at here.

In the following sections, I will describe QFT circuit implementations of
decreasing depth, but also apply our new model of circuit space to see what
kind of trade-off we are making. If you are a theorist, then you will be
excited by the progression of depths of quadratic $O(n^2)$, to log-linear
$O(n\log n)$, to linear $O(n)$, to logarithmic $O(\log n)$, to constant
depth $O(1)$.

We basically ignore the technique of uninitialized qubits, although that
should be an open problem to work on. But we do get to use our combined
circuit space / success probability product. We need a better name for it.
Especially with the approximate circuits.

\subsection{The Basic QFT Circuit in Depth $O(n^2)$}

Now at last, we are ready to see the circuit for the QFT. The most well-known
and straightforward representation is shown here from Nielsen \& Chuang
\cite{Nielsen2000}, in Figure \ref{fig:qft-circuit}.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:qft-circuit}
\caption{The QFT circuit from Nielsen \& Chuang \cite{Nielsen2000}}.
\end{figure}

Note that we are still in the old model of caring about depth, so this is
in the title of all the remaining subsections. But really, my goal is to show
you that depth isn't the whole picture, and using this nifty new concept of
circuit space, you get a much better view of whether you are getting anywhere
or not. Or my name isn't Peter Shor.

Here is the calculation of depth. For qubit $k$, we require $k$ controlled
rotations of $R_2$ up to $R_k$, controlled on qubit $k$ and targeting all
the other qubits. Therefore, the sum of all these numbers is $n(n-1)/2$, 
or $O(n^2)$, as we learned from Gauss's famous childhood story.

This circuit has both size and depth $O(n^2)$ for a QFT of size. It also
has the problem that is operates on qubits which may be very far apart, and
is not very parallel. I assume by this point that I have covered a section
on parallelism techniques, such as those employed by Hoyer and Spalek, and that
furthermore I figured out how to do those weird Nordic characters in the names of
Hoyer and Spalek. However, it doesn't use any ancillae (you know what those
are right, from the preliminary section on circuit resources).

The circuit space of this circuit is something something. To be calculated!

\subsection{The Approximate QFT Circuit in Depth $O(n\log n)$}

Now we leave the world of exact QFTs and see if we can't save some
resources by only approximately computing the QFT. After all, as rotations
get finer and finer, for larger and larger $k$, $R_k$ becomes closer and closer
to the identity, which is to say, doing nothing at all. Intuitively, we can
just cut off rotations after some maximum $k_0$ and still get pretty much
the same QFT. Now this is definitely firmly within the territory of old
homework problems from Aram's class. But we should cite the original paper
by Coppersmith or something.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:qft-approx}
\caption{Circuit for the approximate QFT}
\end{figure}

Let's say we would like a constant error of $\epsilon$, when would we have
to cut off each series of controlled rotations to achieve this?

Here is the calculated error if we cut off at $\log_n$ for each series.

\begin{equation}
???
\end{equation}

Now, we have $n$ qubits and $n$ series of controlled rotations, but now each
series only has at most $O(\log n)$ controlled rotations in it.
This gives us depth and size $O(n \log n)$. However, there still seems to
be money left on the table, ways to parallelize even further.

\subsection{The Nearest-Neighbor QFT Circuit in Depth $O(n)$}

To reduce this to nearest-neighbor architecture and also to operate on
disjoint sets of qubits at the same time, we use the following
construction by Fowler, Devitt, and Hollenberg \cite{Fowler2006}.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:qft-fdh}
\caption{The nearest-neighbor QFT circuit in 1D NTC \cite{Fowler2006}.}
\end{figure}

This, as you know, reduces the depth now to linear $O(n)$. The size and
the space remain the same. So there you have it, it's more physical
realistic, and it's more efficient. Voila!

Also, it makes a pleasing triangular shape. This is what is used in the
nested-adds controlled modular multiplier of Kutin later on in Section
something or other.

Oh, but this was just a tangent into physically realistic architectures.
There is a QFT in linear depth according to folklore, according to Hoyer
and Spalek, so we should try to figure that one out too. Maybe it's the same
one.

\subsection{The Parallelized QFT in Depth $O(\log n)$}

Now we are moving into grown-up techniques which are non-trivial, the
parallel QFT of Cleve \& Watrous which achieve logarithmic depth. Although in
my opinion, erasing the ancillae is overrated. Oh this should set the general
tone of the report. In the beginning I have an engineer's perspective, and
have my sights set on quantum computer engineering. So I don't really care
about things like erasing the ancillae nicely or neglecting the classical
controller just to make a fair comparison and be able to compare circuit
complexity classes directly. So I actually think Cleve \& Watrous going through
all this work to erase their ancillae is silly, especially since you can just
keep it around as garbage. Or even measure it presumably, and then you
automatically have a product state. Am I missing something here? FACT CHECK.
Or simulate in QCL.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:qft-cw}
\caption{The parallel QFT of Cleve and Watrous}
\end{figure}

The above is a picture using the parallel timestep and log-depth fanout of
the qubits. We can mention here the connection to unbounded fanout techniques which
would make this constant depth.

This technique trades space for time, and is basically analogous to the
approach of Super-Kitaev. We should actually describe the Super-Kitaev
approach since we are more familiar with it. By creating multiple QFT states,
hmm, let's see if I actually know how to explain this.

\subsection{The Approximate QFT in Depth $O(1)$}

Well, this is in the Hoyer-Spalek paper. Getting down to exact QFT in 
constant-depth is in BKP, which I can reference here, but I will leave this as
a later thing to read more on if I have time.

Actually, I have no idea how this works at all, even in the approximate case.
But by reading the Hoyer/Spalek paper, I can get a better sense of the
differences between $2^n$ and arbitrary moduli.

\subsection{The Semi-Classical QFT Circuit in Width}

This is the Beauregard circuit, but it is really for phase estimation.
I need to think some more before I go around indiscriminately trying to compare
it directly to other QFT circuits.

\subsection{Open Problems}

Optimizing the QFT circuit even more in terms of improving its space-success
product.
