In particular, when H acts on n qubits, has at most a constant number of nonzero entries in each row/column, and |H| is bounded by a constant, we may select any positive integer \$k\$ such that the simulation requires O(($\backslash$log\^{}*n)t\^{}\{1+1/2k\}) accesses to matrix entries of H. We show that the temporal scaling cannot be significantly improved beyond this, because sublinear time scaling is not possible.},

We improve the procedures of Bravyi and Kitaev in the Hadamard "magic" direction of the Bloch sphere to achieve a sharp threshold between those rho allowing universal quantum computation, and those for which any calculation can be efficiently classically simulated. As a corollary, the ability to repeatedly prepare any pure state which is not a stabilizer state (e.g., any single-qubit pure state which is not a Pauli eigenstate), together with stabilizer operations, gives quantum universality.

We give an upper bound of O(log n + log log (1/epsilon)) on the circuit depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2\^{}n with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log (n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)\^{}2 log log n) on the circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2\^{}n, for which the best previous bound was O(n\^{}2).   As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that factoring is in the complexity class ZPP\^{}BQNC, where BQNC is the class of problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size.   Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of epsilon).},

The time required for solving the Schrodinger equation to obtain molecular energies has been demonstrated to scale polynomially with system size on a quantum computer{,} in contrast to the well-known result of exponential scaling on a classical computer. In this paper{,} we present a quantum algorithm to obtain the energy spectrum of molecular systems based on the multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) wave function. By using a MCSCF wave function as the initial guess{,} the excited states are accessible. Entire potential energy surfaces of molecules can be studied more efficiently than if the simpler Hartree-Fock guess was employed. We show that a small increase of the MCSCF space can dramatically increase the success probability of the quantum algorithm{,} even in regions of the potential energy surface that are far from the equilibrium geometry. For the treatment of larger systems{,} a multi-reference configuration interaction approach is suggested. We demonstrate that such an algorithm can be used to obtain the energy spectrum of the water molecule."
