abstract = {We present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the evolution of a sparse Hamiltonian H for a given time t in terms of a procedure for computing the matrix entries of H. In particular, when H acts on n qubits, has at most a constant number of nonzero entries in each row/column, and |H| is bounded by a constant, we may select any positive integer \$k\$ such that the simulation requires O(($\backslash$log\^{}*n)t\^{}\{1+1/2k\}) accesses to matrix entries of H. We show that the temporal scaling cannot be significantly improved beyond this, because sublinear time scaling is not possible.},

@article{Fowler2009,
abstract = {We present a comprehensive and self-contained simplified review of the quantum computing scheme of Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 190504 (2007), which features a 2-D nearest neighbor coupled lattice of qubits, a threshold error rate approaching 1\%, natural asymmetric and adjustable strength error correction and low overhead arbitrarily long-range logical gates. These features make it by far the best and most practical quantum computing scheme devised to date. We restrict the discussion to direct manipulation of the surface code using the stabilizer formalism, both of which we also briefly review, to make the scheme accessible to a broad audience.},

@article{Hoyer2002,
abstract = {We demonstrate that the unbounded fan-out gate is very powerful. Constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits with bounded fan-in and unbounded fan-out over a fixed basis (denoted by QNCf\^{}0) can approximate with polynomially small error the following gates: parity, mod[q], And, Or, majority, threshold[t], exact[q], and Counting. Classically, we need logarithmic depth even if we can use unbounded fan-in gates. If we allow arbitrary one-qubit gates instead of a fixed basis, then these circuits can also be made exact in log-star depth. Sorting, arithmetical operations, phase estimation, and the quantum Fourier transform with arbitrary moduli can also be approximated in constant depth.},

@article{Reichardt2005,
abstract = {Given stabilizer operations and the ability to repeatedly prepare a single-qubit mixed state rho, can we do universal quantum computation? As motivation for this question, "magic state" distillation procedures can reduce the general fault-tolerance problem to that of performing fault-tolerant stabilizer circuits. We improve the procedures of Bravyi and Kitaev in the Hadamard "magic" direction of the Bloch sphere to achieve a sharp threshold between those rho allowing universal quantum computation, and those for which any calculation can be efficiently classically simulated. As a corollary, the ability to repeatedly prepare any pure state which is not a stabilizer state (e.g., any single-qubit pure state which is not a Pauli eigenstate), together with stabilizer operations, gives quantum universality. It remains open whether there is also a tight separation in the so-called T direction.},

We show that there exists an O(1)-depth O(n log n)-size quantum circuit for the OR function on n bits. This is an affirmative answer to the question of Hoyer and Spalek and implies that QNC\^{}0\_f=QAC\^{}0\_f in contrast to the fact that NC\^{}0 $\backslash$subsetneq AC\^{}0, where QNC\^{}0\_f and QAC\^{}0\_f are the quantum circuit complexity classes corresponding to the classical ones NC\^{}0 and AC\^{}0, respectively. We also show that there exists an O(1)-depth small-size quantum circuit for the threshold function on n bits with a threshold 1 $\backslash$leq t $\backslash$leq n, where the size is O(n log n) when t is close to 1 or n, and it is O(n sqrt\{n log n\}) when t is around n/2.},

First I give a circuit for which none of the about 2n qubits need to be initialised (though we still have to make the usual 2n measurements later on). Then I show how the modular additions in the algorithm can be carried out with a superposition of an arithmetic sequence. This makes parallelisation of Shor's algorithm easier. Finally I show how one can factor with only about 1.5n qubits, and maybe even fewer.},
