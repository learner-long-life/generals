\section{Magic State Distillation}

In 1998, Bravyi and Kitaev proposed an interesting model of computation where
we assume we are able to perform all the Clifford group operations perfectly,
prepare fiducial state $\ket{0}$, perform Pauli measurements, but in
addition we are given multiple copies of some mixed state $\rho$. This last
is a parameter of our model. Under what conditions of $\rho$ are we still
able to do universal quantum computation (\textsc{UQC})?

Wim van Dam has proposed an interesting idea about the interconversion of
magic states to non-magic states.
